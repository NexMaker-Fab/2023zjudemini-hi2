    <h1 id="Project-Theme"><a href="#Project-Theme" class="headerlink" title="Project Theme"></a>Project Theme</h1><p>Childhood is the most vibrant stage of growth and cognition in life, filled with innocent thinking and boundless imagination. Our product aims to provide children with a unique entertainment experience through inflatable toys that shape dynamically changing forest animal figures.</p>
<p>We utilize thermoplastic inflatable materials and carefully crafted storytelling to guide children into microcosmic forest scenes, allowing them to freely explore the varied morphological features of animals through the innovative form of inflation. Additionally, we have incorporated sound, light, and electronic modules to mimic the sounds of different animals, enabling children to engage in a comprehensive experience of perception, interaction, and creation.</p>
<p>By designing interactive activities from the perspective of children’s cognition, our goal is to cultivate their imagination, thinking abilities, and innovative skills, among other personal strengths. We believe that this multidimensional experience will stimulate children’s creativity, enhance their problem-solving capabilities, and foster their personal growth.</p>
<p>Our product is not just a children’s toy; it is a tool that ignites children’s imaginations and helps them develop their unique personalities and talents through interaction and creativity. We are dedicated to providing children with enjoyable and meaningful experiences, adding excitement and inspiration to their journey of growth.</p>
<h1 id="Design-Background"><a href="#Design-Background" class="headerlink" title="Design Background"></a>Design Background</h1><p><strong>17 GOALS TO TRANSFORM OUR WORLD</strong></p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda">The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,</a> adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are an urgent call for action by all countries - developed and developing - in a global partnership. They recognize that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that <strong>improve health and education</strong>, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth – <strong>all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests.</strong></p>
<p><img src="/2023zjudemini-hi2/images/%E8%AE%BE%E8%AE%A1%E5%B7%A5%E7%A8%8B%E5%AD%A6%20de246e66bdf24212a3ec6a3696e93e6e/Untitled.png" alt="Untitled"></p>
<p><strong>Education</strong> is the key that will allow many other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be achieved. When people are able to get quality education they can break from the cycle of poverty.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 15</strong> is about conserving life on land. It is to protect and restore terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and stop biodiversity loss.</p>
<p><img src="/2023zjudemini-hi2/images/%E8%AE%BE%E8%AE%A1%E5%B7%A5%E7%A8%8B%E5%AD%A6%20de246e66bdf24212a3ec6a3696e93e6e/Untitled%201.png" alt="Untitled"></p>
<p>After incorporating this design objective, we utilized the PEST interview method to conduct more detailed research from several aspects: politics, economy, society, and technology.</p>
<p><strong>Politics</strong>: With the adjustment of the national policy on second and third child birth, as well as the emergence of a new generation of young parents, the children’s toy market will encounter new opportunities and challenges. More and more children and parents prefer interactive toys on the basis of traditional toys. Interactive toys provide users with a superior experience in terms of interaction methods and user experience. With the development of technology and the exploration of new materials, heat-sealable inflatable deformable materials have also been promoted and applied in various industries in recent years. Therefore, this project will propose a solution that combines pneumatic deformable materials with children’s cognitive education, taking into account the developmental characteristics and needs of children aged 6-10. This solution aims to not only enhance children’s entertainment experience and increase their interest in learning but also bring new opportunities to the development of children’s toys, aligning with future trends.</p>
<p><strong>Economy</strong>: In terms of economic development, there are various reasons for children’s demand for knowledge in aerodynamics and animal locomotion. The first reason is Employment Opportunities: There is a growing demand for employment opportunities in fields related to animals and climate. As society’s attention to environmental issues increases, the demand in related industries also rises. Additionally, the rise of the green economy, which is based on sustainable development, includes areas such as renewable energy, ecotourism, and sustainable agriculture. With the development of the green economy, the demand for knowledge in animals and climate also increases. Understanding animal and plant conservation, ecosystem management, and the impact of climate change on the economy can help children find more opportunities in the green economy. The other is that increasing Education and Awareness: As the economy develops, people’s education and awareness also improve. The educational and awareness-raising efforts regarding environmental and climate issues in society have also contributed to children’s demand for learning about animals and climate. Schools and educational institutions are increasingly focusing on environmental education, providing relevant courses and activities to cultivate children’s environmental awareness and sense of responsibility. Moreover, there is a growing societal concern for climate change and biodiversity conservation, which further stimulates children’s demand for learning related knowledge.</p>
<p>Overall, the increasing employment opportunities, the rise of the green economy, enhanced education and awareness, and growing societal concern for climate change and biodiversity conservation are the key factors driving children’s demand for learning about aerodynamics and animal locomotion in the context of economic development.</p>
<p><strong>Society</strong>: In the societal aspect, there are two main factors. Firstly, the strengthening of environmental awareness: Contemporary society is increasingly concerned about environmental issues, and people are becoming more aware of the importance of protecting animals and addressing climate change. This heightened environmental awareness creates a demand for learning related knowledge in society, and children are positively influenced by their families, schools, and communities, encouraging them to learn about animals and climate. Secondly, the importance of biodiversity conservation with the development of society: People are gradually realizing the significance of biodiversity for ecological balance and human well-being. Understanding animal species, their ecological roles, and how to protect and restore biodiversity has become a necessary social need. Children’s learning of animal knowledge can foster their respect for and awareness of protecting the natural world.</p>
<p><strong>Technology</strong>: In the field of technology, technological innovation provides scientific visualization tools such as simulation software, data visualization, and virtual reality, making abstract concepts more visual and interactive. Children can observe and explore animal behavior and climate change through these tools, gaining a deeper understanding of related knowledge. With the continuous advancement of technological innovation, including areas such as artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and sustainable energy, the demand for knowledge in animals and climate is also increasing. Acquiring knowledge about animal behavior, ecosystems, and climate change can provide a foundation and inspiration for children to participate in future technological innovations. However, during childhood, obtaining basic technological knowledge is more engaging when followed by hands-on activities. Additionally, appropriate technological challenges and inspirations can help children learn certain technical knowledge.</p>
